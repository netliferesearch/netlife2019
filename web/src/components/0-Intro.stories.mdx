# Get started

Netlife Design System is a reusable component library that helps Netlife document our styles and our components better and share them between disciplines. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

## Install
The components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df). It requires Storybook version 5.2-beta and up.

To run this project, go to <Link href="https://github.com/netliferesearch/netlife2019" title="Netlife repo" className="link focus:shadow-outline">Netlife</Link> and follow instructions there.

### **Use**
A story is a single state of one or more UI components.
Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button, Badge } from ‘./Button’;`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={action('button clicked')} value="Text Button" type="submit" />
      <ButtonLink href="" value="Text Link Button" />
    </div>
  )
```
You can have as many stories as you want.
Usually we create stories for the smaller UI components in the app.


Have a look at the [Writing Stories](https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories) section in the Storybook documentation.
